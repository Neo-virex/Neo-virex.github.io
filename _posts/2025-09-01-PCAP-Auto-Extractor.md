# Mastering Network Forensics: A Deep Dive into PCAP Auto Extractor

The process of extracting and analyzing packet capture (PCAP) files can be time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Today, I'm excited to introduce a powerful tool that simplifies this process: PCAP Auto Extractor.

## What is PCAP Auto Extractor?

PCAP Auto Extractor is a robust, production-quality Bash script that automates the extraction of various protocol data from PCAP files using tshark (Wireshark's command-line tool). It provides an organized approach to network forensics by:

- Automatically extracting data from multiple protocols
- Organizing outputs in a structured directory hierarchy
- Providing an interactive menu system for targeted analysis
- Integrating with specialized GitHub repositories for advanced analysis
- Generating comprehensive summary reports

## Getting Started

### Installation and Prerequisites

Before using PCAP Auto Extractor, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The script includes a handy requirements checker that makes this process straightforward:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pcap-auto-extractor.git
cd pcap-auto-extractor

# Make the scripts executable
chmod +x pcap-auto-extractor.sh requirements.sh

# Check and install dependencies
./requirements.sh --install
```

The script will automatically detect your operating system and install the required packages, including tshark, git, and python3, along with optional tools like exiftool and jq.

### Basic Usage

Once you have the dependencies installed, using PCAP Auto Extractor is simple:

```bash
./pcap-auto-extractor.sh capture.pcap
```

This command will launch the interactive menu system, allowing you to choose how you want to analyze your PCAP file.

## Navigating the Interface

When you first run PCAP Auto Extractor, you'll be greeted with a colorful, professional-looking menu:

```bash
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    PCAP Auto Extractor                        ║
║          Advanced Terminal Automation for PCAP Analysis        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║                         PCAP Auto Extractor - Main Menu                  ║
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Extract ALL (safe, modular)
2. Run a specific extractor
3. GitHub Tools
4. Show Summary
5. Exit
```

Let's explore each option in detail.

## Option 1: Extract ALL

The "Extract ALL" option is perfect for comprehensive analysis when you're not sure what you're looking for or want to perform a thorough investigation. When you select this option, the script will:

1. **Extract Metadata**: Information about network interfaces, link types, and PCAP statistics.
2. **Analyze HTTP Traffic**: Extract requests, hosts, POST bodies, authentication headers, cookies, and even exported objects like images or documents.
3. **Investigate DNS Activity**: Extract queries, answers, TXT records, and all QNames for potential exfiltration indicators.
4. **Examine TCP Conversations**: Identify SYN+ACK ports, TCP conversations, and top talkers.
5. **Uncover Kerberos Activity**: Extract user/realm pairs, ciphers, and generate AS-REP candidates for password cracking.
6. **Collect Credentials**: Find FTP credentials, SMTP subjects, and potential credentials in HTTP POST bodies.
7. **Detect TLS Handshakes**: Extract JA3 fingerprints for TLS client fingerprinting.
8. **Perform Chained Analysis**: Use initial findings to guide deeper analysis, such as extracting URIs for specific hosts or analyzing POST bodies for credentials.

After extraction is complete, you'll be asked if you want to return to the menu or exit, giving you control over your workflow.

## Option 2: Run a Specific Extractor

Sometimes you know exactly what you're looking for, and running all extractors would be overkill. The "Run a specific extractor" option allows you to choose from a comprehensive list of targeted extractors:

```bash
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║                      Select an extractor to run:                       ║
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  2. Meta - Link types
  3. Meta - PCAP stats
  4. Meta - Kerberos fields
  5. HTTP - Requests
  6. HTTP - Hosts
  7. HTTP - POST bodies
  8. HTTP - Auth headers
  9. HTTP - Cookies
 10. HTTP - Export objects
 11. DNS - Queries
 12. DNS - Answers
 13. DNS - TXT records
 14. DNS - All QNames
 15. TCP - SYN+ACK ports
 16. TCP - Conversations
 17. TCP - IP conversations
 18. Kerberos - Users and realms
 19. Kerberos - Ciphers
 20. Kerberos - AS-REP candidates
 21. Credentials - FTP commands
 22. Credentials - FTP credentials
 23. Credentials - SMTP subjects
 24. TLS - JA3 fingerprints
 25. DNS - Exfiltration detection
 26. Chained - HTTP hosts analysis
 27. Chained - Kerberos analysis
 28. Chained - POST bodies analysis
 29. Back to main menu
```

Each extractor is color-coded by category (Meta, HTTP, DNS, TCP, Kerberos, Credentials, TLS), making it easy to find the specific analysis you need.

## Option 3: GitHub Tools

PCAP Auto Extractor integrates with specialized GitHub repositories to extend its capabilities. This option allows you to clone and run tools for specific analysis tasks:

```bash
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║                            GitHub Tools Menu                           ║
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. decrypt-winrm (https://github.com/h4sh5/decrypt-winrm)
2. ctf-tools (https://github.com/truongkma/ctf-tools)
3. john (https://github.com/openwall/john)
4. Back to main menu
```

For example, if you've extracted Kerberos AS-REP candidates, you can use the john or ctf-tools repository to run krbpa2john.py and prepare the data for password cracking. The script will guide you through providing any necessary inputs and save the results in your output directory.

## Option 4: Show Summary
